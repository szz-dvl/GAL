· This software is intended to be used as a game "library" or archiver, it will organize games in lists,
those will be navigable using a gamepad, the configuration file, which must reside in the same directory
of the source files must be named "confis.json", the file "config.skel" can be used as a skeleton to
create one.

Moreover, anyone willing to add some functionalities can easely implement extra button responses in a custom
plugin, the file "plugins/emulator.skel" may be used as a skeleton file to create a custom one, those will need
to reside under the plugins directory and passed in the "class" field of the config file. If no plugin is
available for a given game no extra button functionalities will be mapped.

Have fun!
