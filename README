· This python app is intended to be used as a game "library" or archiver, it will organize games in lists, those will be navigable using a gamepad, the configuration file, which must reside in the same directory of the source files must be named "confis.json", the file "config.skel" can be used as a skeleton to create one.

By default there will be button combinations to change the next slot to be loaded (usefull for emulators) binded to the left / right arrow keys ("lr_arrows") and to increse and decrese the volume binded to the up / down arrows of the gamepad ("ud_arrows"). To trigger this functionalities the master button ("mtr_btn") must be pressed.

Moreover, anyone willing to add some functionalities can easely implement extra button responses in a custom plugin, the file "plugins/emulator.skel" may be used as a skeleton file to create it, those will need to reside under the plugins directory and passed in the "class" field of the config file. If no plugin is available for a given game or emulator no extra button functionalities will be mapped.

Have fun!
